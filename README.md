# About DadBot
DadBot listens for dad jokes, and then pounces! But only when you're not in a heated discussion. DadBot would hate to interrupt your 9 hour rant about how gamers are oppressed.

At least you can take comfort knowing that DadBot is reading your every word, and deciding not to engage.

# Run DadBot Locally
Add a file called auth.json with 
```JSON
{
    "token": "aaaa"
}
```
where "aaaa" is your discord bot's authorization token.

Navigate to DadBot's home (folder) and type 
"node bot.js"
into your command prompt.

To kill him, press Ctrl+C. He'd thank you if he could.
